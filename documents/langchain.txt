LangChain is a framework for developing applications powered by language models. It enables applications that are:
- Data-aware: connect a language model to other sources of data
- Agentic: allow a language model to interact with its environment

The main value props of LangChain are:
1. Components: composable tools and integrations for working with language models
2. Off-the-shelf chains: built-in assemblages of components for higher-level tasks
3. Easy to extend: easily extend existing chains or create new ones

LangChain provides modules for:
- Models: integrate with various LLM providers
- Prompts: manage and optimize prompts
- Chains: combine multiple components
- Indexes: prepare and query data
- Memory: persist state between calls
- Agents: dynamically choose which tools to use
