FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

Key features of FastAPI include:
- Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.
- Fast to run: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go.
- Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn.
- Standards-based: Based on the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI and JSON Schema.
- Automatic interactive API documentation.

FastAPI is built on top of Starlette for the web parts and Pydantic for the data parts.
It uses asynchronous request handling by default, making it highly efficient for I/O-bound operations.
